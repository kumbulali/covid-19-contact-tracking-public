<a name="_page1_x68.00_y71.00"></a>**ABSTRACT** 

The Covid-19 Contact Tracking System is used for controlling the contacts of the users of the application via valid and verified PCR/Antigen tests that are uploaded to the system. This application is available for the staff and students of the Computer Engineering Department of EMU. Application is verifying the uploaded PCR/Antigen tests to mark the user as Covid-19 positive or negative and it will use Bluetooth as the method for getting the distance between users. Distance between users will affect the current status of the user, if user gets closer than 1.5 meters to a user that is Covid-19 positive or a contacted user, the users’ status will be risky. The mobile application is developed by using Flutter and Firebase. In the end, the project is well-designed, well documented, easily accessible and user friendly.

1. **INTRODUCTION<a name="_page11_x68.00_y71.00"></a>** 

In this project, we developed the COVID-19 CONTACT TRACKING SYSTEM, a fully functional application that monitors the number of people you have contacted during the covid- 19 pandemic and notifies you if you are at risk. During the development of this project, we chose  Agile Development Model from SDLC methodologies because  Agile Development Model is the best option to understand the requirements in small and medium scale software projects like this. Also, this model allows us to scale this project easily. 

The Covid-19 Contact Tracking System keeps the contacts in the database by scanning other devices in the background in real time via the Bluetooth module of the device, and keeps the contacts in the database, and sends a notification to everyone who comes into contact with them in case there is a risky person among them. You can track how many people you are in contact with daily in the application and upload your PCR, Antigen test results. 

The biggest reason why we designed this application is to reduce the spread of the covid- 19 virus by warning people and to ensure the protection of social distance. 

2. **PROJECT PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT**

2. **Aim,<a name="_page12_x68.00_y281.00"></a> Purpose, Target Users** 

**The primary aim** of the Covid-19 Contact Tracking System is to try to keep the students and lecturers at our school safe during the pandemic and to prevent the pandemic from spreading even faster. 

**The target users** of the system are Eastern Mediterranean University students and staff. 

**The purpose** of the Covid-19 Contact Tracking System is to prevent the spread of the pandemic by detecting people at risk of covid through contacts. 

3. **The<a name="_page12_x68.00_y492.00"></a> Reason of Starting this Project** 

**The main reason of starting the Covid-19 Contact Tracking System** is to prevent the spread of the pandemic by detecting people at risk of covid through contacts. With this application, the Bluetooth module in our smartphones, which we all have in our pockets, is prevented to a certain extent from scanning the devices around and exceeding the social distance. We can easily receive warnings if there are risks among the people, we exceed the social distance. 

4. **Output<a name="_page12_x68.00_y631.00"></a> / Success Criteria of the Project** 

At the end of this project, we aim to achieve a fully functional mobile contact tracking system. In this system, you can upload the PCR and Antigen test results, follow the results, and view the number of people you contact daily and real-time. This application is suitable for people who have had a covid-19 PCR or Antigen test. Otherwise, the app won't be able to know your pandemic health status.

2. **Non-Functional<a name="_page40_x68.00_y184.00"></a> Requirements** 
1. *Security<a name="_page40_x68.00_y210.00"></a>*  

The application will keep all user information in Firebase which is a database service that Google Inc. provides. Firebase is a very reliable service that has very low chance of malicious or accidental actions outside of the designed usage of the system. 

- System will be backed up time to time to prevent losing data in case of any system failure. 
- All user information will be held encrypted and secured in a secure path for improved security. 
- All admin features require Firebase Admin SDK to improve reliability. We developed an API to use Firebase Admin SDK to access Firebase Admin features. 
2. *Efficiency<a name="_page40_x68.00_y407.00"></a>*  

The application should not drain battery of the mobile phone. Application will get the distance between two mobile phones via Bluetooth Low Energy Technology so it will be battery efficient. 

3. *Reusability<a name="_page40_x68.00_y507.00"></a>* 

The application will be usable again under any other new pandemic circumstance. When necessary, modifications are done for the new pandemic, it will become useful again. 

4. *Usability<a name="_page40_x68.00_y584.00"></a>* 

The  application  is  providing  opportunity  to  perform  the  desired  operation  safely, efficiently, effectively, and easily while inside context of use. 

5. *Accessibility<a name="_page40_x68.00_y661.00"></a>* 

Anyone that can use a mobile phone will be able to use the application as desired. Since we use Firebase, i.e., Google Cloud Platform, for background services, our accessibility is 24/7 and very fast from all over the world. 

6. *Scalability<a name="_page41_x68.00_y71.00"></a>* 

For the staff and students that are in Computer Engineering Department of EMU, Firebase will be enough. If necessary and desired, with little expenses the application can be scaled up and serve higher amount of people. 

7. *Extensibility<a name="_page41_x68.00_y167.00"></a>* 

The  application  is  well  designed  and  prepared  for  future  extensions  that  may  be implemented, whether these extensions are addition of a new function or modifying an existing one. 

3. **Realistic<a name="_page41_x68.00_y265.00"></a> constraints**  
- Mobile phone is required for using the application. 
- Using the application consumes battery of the phone. 
- The application is designed for the circumstances of the Covid-19 pandemic, after the end of Covid-19 pandemic, application will not be useful. It can be modified to meet the requirements of any other new pandemic that may occur.  
- It is ethically necessary to provide adequate security to prevent any damage to user information. 
- The application is manufactured using completely available and free resources. 
4. **Ethical<a name="_page41_x68.00_y418.00"></a> issues**  

Personal information of every user will be held in the database, providing security, and not sharing them with third parties will be necessary to ensure ethical safety. 

4. **DESIGN<a name="_page42_x68.00_y71.00"></a>** 
1. **High<a name="_page42_x68.00_y99.00"></a> level design (architectural)** 

While  preparing  High  Level  Architectural  Design,  we  decided  to  use  the  Google Firebase service so that the number of resources that may be required for the services of the application is elastic and reliable. In this way, the pricing will be as much as we use, and the services will be active and reliable 24/7. You can see the related Architecture Diagram in Figure 3. As you can see here, Admin requires access to Firebase with Firebase Admin SDK to eliminate Firebase security vulnerability if user can delete, update and add. In this context, we have developed the CCTS (Covid-19 Contact Tracking System) Admin API with Typescript- NodeJS to authorize our requests to the background of the Admin Panel and increase its security.

![](Aspose.Words.efbcfe09-02b4-4b6f-bdd6-8dff685bce89.026.jpeg)

An activity diagram shows software processes as a progression of actions. When the user opens the application, the system first checks the authentication in the background and sends it directly to the home page if the user is authenticated or redirects it to the SignInSignUp page if the user is not authenticated. An error message will appear on the screen if an invalid credential is entered on the SignIn or Register pages. When the home page is reached without error, the user can go to the PCR / ANTIGEN page and upload the test result. During this download, if the file does not have a .pdf extension or is larger than 2MB, an error message will be displayed, and you will be directed to the file upload page. If the file is in suitable conditions, it is converted to JPEG format and it is checked for QR or DATA\_MATRIX code using Machine Learning. If any  of  these  two  codes  exist,  the  code  is  converted  to  the  URL  and  the  HTML  data corresponding to the URL is scraped with the appropriate libraries and it is checked whether the data on the site match with the user. If it matches, whether the PCR/Antigen test is within 72 hours is checked from the data pulled from the site, and if appropriate, the user's healthStatus is automatically updated.

![](Aspose.Words.efbcfe09-02b4-4b6f-bdd6-8dff685bce89.027.png)The Entity Relationship diagram above shows the model classes we use in our system and their relationships. Each entity in the diagram can be thought of as an object with a property or attribute in the system. For example, the users and contacts entities. Users have id, name, surname, phone, Email, sex, birthDate, signUpDate,* ucid, healthStatus and email. Contacts have features that keep singleContactID, UUID’s (UNIQUE USER IDENTIFIER) of two people making contact, UCID's (UNIQUE CONTACT IDENTIFIER) of two people's, latitude, longitude and date of that the contact took place. These attributes provide information about all these objects. In terms of system functionality, if two users get close without observing social distance, the UCID's and UUID’s of both users are kept in the database together with the date, latitude and longitude of the contact as a contacts object. For this reason, there is a relationship between users and contacts.*

![](Aspose.Words.efbcfe09-02b4-4b6f-bdd6-8dff685bce89.028.png)

As seen in the diagram above, assuming the user has an account, there will be some entries in the system that we need to log into. These can be e-mail and password entries. The information that entered by the user will be checked. If user entered valid information that identify their existing account, they will be successfully entered. Otherwise, verification will be unsuccessful and there will be error message on the screen. System checks user information with the database records. Also, if we assume that there is not any account of the user, they must sign up first. There will be signup form on the system they will sign. The system will send a request to database for signing then sign-up page will be displayed on the screen. After those users will enter their personal information’s. Then validity control will be made on entered information’s, if they are valid the sign up will be successfully completed but if not, sign up will be unsuccessful and display unsuccessful message to the user.

As seen in the diagram above, assuming the admin has an account, there will be some entries in the system that we need to log into. These can be e-mail and password entries. The information that entered by the admin will be checked. If Admin entered valid information that identify their existing account, they will be successfully entered. Otherwise, verification will be unsuccessful and there will be error message on the screen. After the admin has successfully logged in, the user reaches the screen where he can delete and add again. Admin can delete the relevant user by querying the system with the id number of the user he/she wants to delete. 

5. **IMPLEMENTATION<a name="_page52_x68.00_y226.00"></a>** 
1. **Tools,<a name="_page52_x68.00_y255.00"></a> technologies and platforms used** 

Since the app must be developed on mobile, the app has been developed using the very advanced Flutter UI Toolkit that allows us to get native builds for both iOS and Android. During the development, we used the flutter\_beacon library to continuously broadcast and scan around the BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy™) technology of the Bluetooth module by consuming low power. We developed the server side using secure, 24/7 active and scalable Google Firebase. We needed the firebase\_core and firebase\_auth libraries in Flutter to be able to access this cloud service.  In  this  way,  we  provided  direct  access  to  the  affordable  and  high-performance Authentication API offered by Google without using an additional API. Since Google keeps the security of admin processes at a very high level, it is necessary to access a REST API using the  Firebase  Admin  SDK  so  that  we  can  perform  CRUD  operations  on  the  Firebase Authentication API. For this, a CCTS Admin API was developed using the Firebase Admin SDK using the Express framework with NodeJS-Typescript.  

We used the Android emulator with Visual Studio Code and Android Studio AVD Manager during development. Figma and Adobe Photoshop were used for the designs.

3. **Standards<a name="_page54_x68.00_y71.00"></a>** 

The standards we used in this project are as follows: 

- Software Requirements Specification Document: IEEE 830-1998 
- Implementation: Google Development  
4. **Detailed<a name="_page54_x68.00_y187.00"></a> description of the implementation (coding)** 

Since the mobile application is planned to be developed for Android and iOS, it was decided to develop it using the Flutter Mobile Development UI Kit. In line with this decision, the development of the application was built with the development of Authentication systems as the first stage. 

<a name="_page54_x68.00_y306.00"></a>*Authentication* 

While  developing  the  Authentication  system,  the  Authentication  API  provided  by Firebase is used, but this Authentication API has disadvantages as well as advantages. The most important  factor  that  can  be  mentioned  as  an  advantage  is  that  it  fully  supports  OAuth technology and the SMS Auth we have used in our system. The disadvantage is that adding and removing user data is very complicated and limited. Based on this, we can open a record of the user with the same UUID directly to the Firebase Firestore Database and play all the games we want in it, if the user can register without error during registration. Afterwards, we added a Phone Number Verification system to prevent users from opening more than one account and to increase user accuracy. This system uses Firebase Phone Auth in the background, but not for login. We tricked Google into using SMS verification not to log into the app, but to verify the phone number of a user who is already logged into the app. Since the data is checked in real- time as a background, we also made it mandatory and automatic to direct the user to the relevant page to add that data in case of any missing data in the database, so that we prevent use in such a critical application when user accuracy is lacking. 

<a name="_page54_x104.00_y631.00"></a>*Main Functions* 

During the main screen front end development process, we kept the interface as simple as possible in order to ensure that the technical infrastructure of our application is high, but that all users can use it easily. When the application is first opened, it is directed to the landing page, sign in Sign Up Page, and the buttons that the user can be directed to Login or Register pages are faced with. After completing the process on the relevant screen, if authenticate is enabled, the user is directed to the main page and the Bluetooth, Background Service and Location Service permissions are requested from the user. If the user approves, the application uses the user data in the background to run the BLE iBeacon Broadcast and Scan systems, check if there is another user around, and at the same time broadcast the UCID we have determined around the device so that it can be detected by other devices. If the device encounters another device around, it directly asks the database whether the device it encountered is in our systems, then if the encountered device is located in our systems, it asks if it has encountered before during the day and if it is not encountered, the contact is created in the database and the counter on the application main screen works in real time. The number added to the database also affects the counter and the number of contacts is increased by 1. Every day at 12:00PM in the evening, the daily chart is transferred to the chart on the RiskLevel screen, and the daily chart is reset.

8. DISCUSSION 

Thanks to this application, reaching the medical risk information of each staff and student  at  the  department  of  computer  engineering  related  to  Covid-19  will  get  easier. Application will automatically change the current state to ‘risky’ from ‘riskless’ if there are any Covid-19 positive cases which the user has been contacted in the last few days. This will help the department staff to take quick action if necessary. While it may not seem like a real savings for staff and students, it is. If a user is in ‘risky’ state, the application and pandemic reasons will prompt the user to have a PCR/Antigen test and if the result is positive, the user will be quarantined. This process is important on a broader perspective because when a person is positive without knowing it, the risk of infecting other people is much higher than in quarantine, and if that is the case, more and more people will have to do PCR/Antigen testing. Since PCR/Antigen tests are paid, the total amount spent on these tests will gradually increase. On the other hand, the fight against pandemic will be easier in this way. 

9. **CONCLUSION<a name="_page74_x68.00_y102.00"></a>** 

This project is meant for fighting against pandemic. The application requires a valid PCR/Antigen test to assign a current health state to the user, ‘Riskless’ or ‘Risky’. In general, this project can lead a decrease to the total amount of money spent on PCR/Antigen tests and letting people know that they were contacted with other Covid-19 positive cases which is helping them to get action quicker. Throughout the project, we have learned various project management methods and we have learned and improved ourselves in Flutter, Figma and Firebase. In general, we got better in practice.
